This experimental setup needs a simple modification of PostgreSQL sources.
src/backend/tsearch/dict_thesaurus.c makes uses of 16 bits unsigned integers
(uint16) to represents terms. This limits the capacity of the dictionary to
65535 terms. As there is more than 4 millions distinct title pages in the French Wikipedia, we modified the source code to make use of 32 bits unsigned integers
(uint32). 

What we have to do is to turn this modification into a new dictionary template,
thesaurus32.
